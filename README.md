# Cool

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a compiler for the Classroom Object-Oriented Language (COOL) developed as part of [Stanford's CS143 Compilers](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/) course. The compiler translates COOL programs to MIPS assembly code through a series of well-defined phases.
